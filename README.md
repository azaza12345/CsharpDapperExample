### :triangular_flag_on_post: *Introduction*
I present to your attention my small <b>fullstack project</b>!
It was created in order to improve my skills in backend development, learn Angular,
work with important technologies and continue my way as a C# developer

### :pencil2: *Description*
The project involves the client interacting with the server by sending and processing http requests. This application implements basic data manipulation operations by the user:
+ _Product_ and _Category_ creation
+ Getting data about existing _Products, Categories_ and their features
+ Changing _Product_ and _Categories_ features
+ View _Product_ details at home page
+ Adding and removing _Products_ from a shopping cart
+ Removing entities
